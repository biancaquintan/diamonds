This code is a Ruby solution to the following challenge.

<hr>

Given a set of characters, you'll need to extract the "diamonds" <> and the "sands" . of the expression until there is nothing more to be extracted., and at the end display the amount of diamonds extracted.

**Tips:**
* The diamond is the junction of the lesser < and greater > signs without there being anything between them.
* Sand is the end point.
* Consider that when extracting a diamond a new diamond can be formed.
